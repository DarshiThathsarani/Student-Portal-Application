# Student Portal Application
 This application build an ASP.NET Core MVC CRUD application using Entity Framework Core and SQL Server. Leveraging the .NET 8 MVC template in Visual Studio 2022, we'll walk through the creation of a fully functional CRUD app.  The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern, a widely adopted software architecture, particularly popular when paired with the ASP.NET framework.  To enhance the user interface, we will incorporate Bootstrap 5 for styling our web pages. We'll install the necessary EF Core packages and utilize the code-first approach to set up the SQL Server database.
